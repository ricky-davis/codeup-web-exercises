                You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

                A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them.

                If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Take your time. Speed will come later.
